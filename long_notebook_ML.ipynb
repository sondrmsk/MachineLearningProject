    "Solar power is generated through photo voltaic – PV  – cells absorbing the energy from photons emitted by the sun. As so, at the most basic level, the effect of solar panels (the amount of energy they produce) is a result of how much sun they are exposed to (DOE). Of course, panels can therefore not produce energy if the sun is down, i.e. at night. Still, there is more to it. Photons, which can be considered as solar rays, are dependent on striking panels at a sudden minimum angle if they are to be absorbed and not reflected (OSTI). Even though interaction with particles in the atmosphere distorts the direction of photons, their direction is predominantly given by the sun’s angle relative to the surface. Therefore, in the early morning and late afternoon, one might expect the amount of photons that strike the solar panels at a sufficiently steep angle to be less than around the middle of the day when the sun is at its highest. This results in a gradual increase and decrease in PV energy generated at each side of mid-day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further on, there are other factors that affect the panels’ effect. These factors include whatever might block sunrays from striking the panels, even when the sun is up. This might include fog, clouds or general air humidity which will decrease the direct radiation, but also things that might cover the actual panels, such as snow. Additionally, the temperature of the panels affects their efficiency, as heat results in increased electrical resistance and therefore lower output. For this reason, surface temperatures might be an important factor, as warmer weather will increase the temperature of the panels. Wind should also be taken into consideration, as higher wind speeds should have a cooling effect. A non-external factor that also could be considered is that while aging, panels generally tend to perform worse, as performance typically decreases by 0.5% each year (NRL).\n",

    "The dataset shows the amount PV energy generated by by solar panels at three different locations aggregated hourly (pv_measurement), as well as 45 weather related features at the associated location logged every 15 minutes. Further on, while the PV measurements are only historical observed data, the weather features consists of both observed and estimated data. Further on, the historical weather data seems to be mix of in-situ data, as well as remotely sensed data. In-situ data is measure at the location at the event, for example the PV energy (pv_measurement) generated from the solar panels at location A, B and C, as well as data that might have been measured from a ground-based station located closely, such as a radiosonde. The remotely sensed data on the other hand might be derived from entities such as radars and satellites, and does not observe the meteorological phenomenon itself, but instead some consequence of it, and usually makes use of some mathematical modeling in order to provide a feature of interest. For this reason, it is not necessarily as accurate as direct observations (Meteomatics, historical). The estimated part of the weather-related features has naturally been derived from forecasting, which is done through large computer simulations using mathematical and physical laws to predict based on observational input (Meteomatics, forecast).\n",
